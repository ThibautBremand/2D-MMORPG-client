# 2D-MMORPG-client
The client for 2D-MMORPG, written in TypeScript.

For the server, please see https://github.com/ThibautBremand/2D-MMORPG-server

This client displays the game as canvas in the user's browser, it handles user's inputs from the keyboard, and it interacts with the server in order to communicate with the other users.

## Local installation

- Clone the repo
- Run ***npm run build*** in order to generate a bundled ***app.js*** JavaScript file, into the ***dist*** directory
- Deploy this app.js file alongside the server as detailed in the server's Readme file.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure you have the following elements installed on your system:
- node.js
- npm
- TypeScript
- webpack
